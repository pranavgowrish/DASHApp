# DASHApp
During my time as Co-Founder of The DASH Project, I used Java to create an application to help keep my team up to date with what they have to do for each new awareness topic. In addition to this, for motivation, they are made aware of the hours they've dedicated to each cause. This versatile app is also used to generate unique certificates and for the members to access important resources.
